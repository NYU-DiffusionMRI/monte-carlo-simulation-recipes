# Recipes of Monte Carlo simulations

This is the four exemplified Monte Carlo simulations in Figure 4 of Fieremans and Lee, NI 2018 with more details in Supplmentary Information\\

Example 1 (Figure 4, point 1): Free diffusion in 2d\\
Example 2 (Figure 4, point 2): Check short-time limit of diffusion in randomly packed impermeable cylinders (2d)\\
Example 3 (Figure 4, point 3): Check against analytical formulas for diffusion within an impermeable non-absorbing cylinder (2d)\\
Example 4 (Figure 4, point 5): Calculate membrane's permeability by starting diffusing particles from the center of a permeable cylinder (2d)\\

These are good exercises if you just start your own MC simulation codes.\\
Some results can suprise you, even if you are well experienced!!\\
